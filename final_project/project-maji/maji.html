       <b> How might we use game design to help the youth feel represented and affirmed in their self worth?</b>
       <br>
       <br>

       In an effort to increase diversity in gaming, I partnered with programming students 
       at Howard University to create a game that reflected who we were collectively 
       through an innovative storyline. 

       <b>Our solution was a 2D mermaid platformer that used water as a game mechanic.</b>

       <p class="paragraph">
        Led as concept artist and co-led as game designer, collaborating with programmers and another artist.
        Involved in every step of production pipeline, from ideation to final production in Unity. 
        I experimented with emerging technology by collaborating with the AI MidJourney art generator 
        to come up with ideas for character and environment design. 
        We drew inspiration from these ideas to create designs of our own.

 <div class="section">
     <div class="research">
           <p class="paragraph">
            Studies show that there is a lack of racial and gender diversity in the gaming industry, which consists predominantly of caucasian males. This is reflected in the products being designed. According to Diamond Lobby, a gaming resource website:

             <li class="paragraph"> 
              Approximately 80% of main protagonists in gaming are male and 20% are female
             </li>
             <br>
             <li class="paragraph"> 
              Approximately 54% of main characters are Caucasian
             </li>
             <br>
             <li class="paragraph">
              Approximately 8% of games had a female main character or African American, Asian, or other ethnic origin 
            
             </li>
           </p>

   <h2 class="title"> Story and Design Goals </h2>
     <div class="section">
       <div class="goals">
           <p class="paragraph">
              <b>Story:</b>  The Queen Mother and Immortal Protector has fallen ill from a mysterious 
              illness from the Land Above. Her people are now leaderless and don’t know what to do. 
              Maji Kibibi, which is Swahili for “Water Princess”, is the Queen Mother’s daughter and 
              princess of the Ocean. She is tasked with the responsibility of healing the fish in 
              the ocean and protecting her people from further harm.
            <br> 
            <br>
              <b>Design Goal:</b>Create a 2D platformer game where a female teenage African mermaid is 
              the main protagonist. We drew inspiration from the popular game Celeste for art and 
              story direction.  
             <br>
             <br>

             We used the Transformational Framework to apply in our design goals of identity, belief and society according to the Transformational Framework. 
             <br>
             <br>
             <b>Identity-</b> Help player’s increase positive affirmation towards their sense of self. 
             <br>
             <br>
             <b>Belief- </b> Help players alter their perception of different 
             ethnicities and see more universal commonalities between groups of people.
             <br>
             <br>
             <b>Society-</b> Help users feel more optimistic about the ability to treat each other
              respectfully in society.

                Throughout our game design process, we used two platforms,

                To adapt to emerging AI technology, we experimented with the Midjourney AI art generator 
                to find inspiration for our character and environment designs. 
                We wrote prompts that drew inspiration from shows and games we enjoy, 
                such as <i>Celeste</i> and <i>Avatar the Last Airbender</i>.

                <b>Key Takeaways from this Experiment: </b>
                After sharing these images with the rest of the team, 
                we chose a color palette and narrowed down on the protagonists’ look. 
                Short, natural Afro hair felt particularly relatable for my teammates 
                so this was incorporated into the final design.

                <b>Reflection of using AI as a collaborative tool:</b> The AI results inspired us 
                to create something new. However, the results alone lacked cohesiveness and 
                the human touch needed to meet specific targets in our story.  
                The AI served more as an ideation tool for our team.
