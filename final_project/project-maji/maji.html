        <b> How might we use game design to help the youth feel represented and affirmed in their self worth?</b>
        <br>
        <br>

        In an effort to increase diversity in gaming, I partnered with programming students
        at Howard University to create a game that reflected who we were collectively
        through an innovative storyline.

        <b>Our solution was a 2D mermaid platformer that used water as a game mechanic.</b>

    <h2 class="title"> My Role</h2>

    <p class="paragraph">
      Led as concept artist and co-led as game designer, collaborating with programmers and another artist.
      Involved in every step of production pipeline, from ideation to final production in Unity.
      I experimented with emerging technology by collaborating with the AI MidJourney art generator
      to come up with ideas for character and environment design.
      We drew inspiration from these ideas to create designs of our own.

  <h2 class="title"> Context </h2>
  <div class="section">
    <div class="research">
      <p class="paragraph">
        Studies show that there is a lack of racial and gender diversity in the gaming industry, which consists
        predominantly of caucasian males. This is reflected in the products being designed. According to Diamond Lobby,
        a gaming resource website:

        <li class="paragraph">
          Approximately 80% of main protagonists in gaming are male and 20% are female
        </li>
        <br>
        <li class="paragraph">
          Approximately 54% of main characters are Caucasian
        </li>
        <br>
        <li class="paragraph">
          Approximately 8% of games had a female main character or African American, Asian, or other ethnic origin

  <h2 class="title"> Story and Design Goals </h2>
  <div class="section">
    <div class="goals">
      <p class="paragraph">
        <b>Story:</b> The Queen Mother and Immortal Protector has fallen ill from a mysterious
        illness from the Land Above. Her people are now leaderless and don’t know what to do.
        Maji Kibibi, which is Swahili for “Water Princess”, is the Queen Mother’s daughter and
        princess of the Ocean. She is tasked with the responsibility of healing the fish in
        the ocean and protecting her people from further harm.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Design Goal:</b>Create a 2D platformer game where a female teenage African mermaid is
        the main protagonist. We drew inspiration from the popular game Celeste for art and
        story direction.
        <br>
        <br>

        We used the Transformational Framework to apply in our design goals of identity, belief and society according to
        the Transformational Framework.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Identity-</b> Help player’s increase positive affirmation towards their sense of self.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Belief- </b> Help players alter their perception of different
        ethnicities and see more universal commonalities between groups of people.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Society-</b> Help users feel more optimistic about the ability to treat each other
        respectfully in society.

        <b>Ideation and Early Iterations</b>
        <br>
        <br>
        <li class="paragraph">
          To adapt to emerging AI technology, we experimented with the Midjourney AI art generator
          to find inspiration for our character and environment designs.
          We wrote prompts that drew inspiration from shows and games we enjoy,
          such as <i>Celeste</i> and <i>Avatar the Last Airbender</i>.
        </li>
        <br>
        <br>
        <li class="paragraph">
          <b>Key Takeaways from this Experiment: </b>
          After sharing these images with the rest of the team,
          we chose a color palette and narrowed down on the protagonists’ look.
          Short, natural Afro hair felt particularly relatable for my teammates
          so this was incorporated into the final design.

        <li class="paragraph">
          <b>Reflection of using AI as a collaborative tool:</b> The AI results inspired us
          to create something new. However, the results alone lacked cohesiveness and
          the human touch needed to meet specific targets in our story.
          The AI served more as an ideation tool for our team.

        We presented a lo-fi prototype to guests from Rockstar Games, creators of Grand Theft Auto.
        Our first prototype had an underwater and overwater level. They gave this feedback:

        <br>
        <br>
        <li class="list">
          It may be good to combine the two areas into one for a more reasonable scope.
        </li>
        <br>
        <br>
        <li class="list">
          Better to focus on one level and making it really good than to spread too thin
          having multiple levels.
        </li>
        <br>
        <br>
        <li class="list">
          Help users identify where the protagonist is in the game, using animation or other visual cues.

      <p class="paragraph">
        <b>Based on Rockstar's feedback we made the following changes: </b>
      </p>

      <li class="list">
        Reduced the scope of our game to focus on the underwater environment.
      </li>

      <br>
      <br>

      <li class="list">
        Adjusted the background so it is cooler in temperature and easier
        to distinguish Maji in the foreground.
      </li>

      <br>
      <br>

      <li class="list">
        Focus on creating a cohesive gameplay where Maji is on a quest to heal poisoned fish.
        She takes hits and damage but also has the power to use a laser beam and a defense bubble to heal the fish in
        time.
