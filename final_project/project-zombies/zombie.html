        <b> How might we help reduce food waste through game design?</b>
        <br>
        <br>
        The topic of practicing food sustainability can feel overwhelming, 
        and there are many angles to address the problem space. 
        <b>Our solution is a digital game experience that helps players reduce food waste at the consumer
          level.</b>

        Led the user experience design and research as well as the art and story direction for the game. 
        This included building the user interface and assets for greater engagement and immersive gameplay.

        Delivered user flows, game assets created in Adobe Photoshop and Figma, 
        insights from semi-structured and expert interviews, visual design, and the design system.

  <h2 class="title"> Research </h2>  
  <div class="section">
      <div class="research">
            <p class="paragraph">
              We performed the following to better understand our problem space on sustainable eating behavior:
            
              <li class="paragraph"> 
                Conducted 2 focus group sessions with 10 graduate students at Carnegie Mellon University. We asked them to choose a metaphor that accurately described how they felt about certain statements on food sustainability such as “How I feel about my grocery budget” or “How I feel about food waste”.  
              </li>
              <br>
              <li class="paragraph"> 
                Interviewed 3 experts including a dietician, a supply chain analyst at a food delivery company, and a former chef who now works as a planner in food manufacturing to gain insight on common barriers to sustainable eating behavior.
              </li>
              <br>
              <li class="paragraph">
                Conducted a literature review of 10 academic papers on the topic of HCI and food consumption behaviors to learn if there are existing interventions that could be applied to our design. 
              </li>
            </p>

          <p class="paragraph"> Based on our research, we gained several key insights: 
              <li class="paragraph">
                There were common themes that arose such as the feeling of guilt, inevitability, and loss of control around food waste.
              </li>
              <br>
              <li class="paragraph">
                Education and awareness are the first steps to feeling empowered to make a change when it comes to reducing food waste. 
              </li>
              <br>
              <li class="paragraph">
                Overall, the vast majority of participants want to be more conscious about the impact their food choices have on the world around them. However, although most of the participants understand that food choices do have some kind of impact on the world, they believe it is hard to perceive such effects due to lack of visibility and immeasurability of their personal influence.

    <h2 class="title"> Goals and Objectives </h2>
      <div class="section">
        <div class="goals">
            <p class="paragraph">
              <b>Goal:</b> Based on our research, we created a digital game that promotes 
              positive emotions and behaviors for young adults ages 18 through 25 living in 
              urban city areas to help them reduce food waste. 

            <br> 
            <br>
              In the game solution, we created opportunities for players to learn about on new recipes 
              to minimize food waste, cues to encourage positive food consumption behaviors, 
              and social interactions to trigger ripple effects of sustainable behaviors 
              among the social group. 
              
              We embedded persuasive techniques including intermixing, obfuscation, Self Determination Theory, 
              compliance, and conformity to create psychological distance from a heavy topic. 
              <br>
              <br>

              We used the Transformational Framework to apply in our design goals of knowledge, disposition and behavior according to the Transformational Framework. 
              <br>
              <br>
              <b>Knowledge-</b> Educate users on how their personal actions can make a difference on food sustainability, and how individual food items make a difference on the environment. 
              <br>
              <br>
              <b>Disposition-</b> Transform user’s feelings of guilt about food waste to feelings of empowerment and self affirmation towards the problem. 
              <br>
              <br>
              <b>Behavior-</b> Help users change their eating and cooking habits to increase sustainable action.

    <h2 class="title"> Design and Playtesting </h2>

                <b> Ideation </b>
                <br>
                <br>
                Throughout our game design process, we used three platforms to brainstorm and ideate 
                the game mechanics and interface design (Miro, Figma, and Google Sheets)Ideation 
                and early iterations. We created a paper prototype to find a quick way to brainstorm 
                game components and mechanics. This was used to playtest and receive feedback on user 
                experience pain points.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Mid to High Fidelity Prototypes</b>
                <br>
                <br>
                As we solidifed our designs into a playable game, our team moved from paper prototype to 
                Figma to create a higher fidelity version of the assets and user interface. 
                Our programmers brought these assets into Javascript and React to create a higher 
                fidelity prototype.
