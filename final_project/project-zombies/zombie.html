        <b> How might we help reduce food waste through game design?</b>
        <br>
        <br>
        The topic of practicing food sustainability can feel overwhelming,
        and there are many angles to address the problem space.
        <b>Our solution is a digital game experience that helps players reduce food waste at the consumer
          level.</b>

      Led the user experience design and research as well as the art and story direction for the game.
      This included building the user interface and assets for greater engagement and immersive gameplay.

      Delivered user flows, game assets created in Adobe Photoshop and Figma,
      insights from semi-structured and expert interviews, visual design, and the design system.

  <h2 class="title"> Research </h2>
  <div class="section">
    <div class="research">
      <p class="paragraph">
        <b>We performed the following to better understand our problem space on sustainable eating behavior:</b>

        <li class="list">
          Conducted 2 focus group sessions with 10 graduate students at Carnegie Mellon University. We asked them to
          choose a metaphor that accurately described how they felt about certain statements on food sustainability such
          as “How I feel about my grocery budget” or “How I feel about food waste”.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li class="list">
          Interviewed 3 experts including a dietician, a supply chain analyst at a food delivery company, and a former
          chef who now works as a planner in food manufacturing to gain insight on common barriers to sustainable eating
          behavior.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li class="list">
          Conducted a literature review of 10 academic papers on the topic of HCI and food consumption behaviors to
          learn if there are existing interventions that could be applied to our design.
        </li>
      </p>

      <p class="paragraph"> <b> Based on our research, we gained several key insights:</b>
        <li class="list">
          There were common themes that arose such as the feeling of guilt, inevitability, and loss of control around
          food waste.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li class="list">
          Education and awareness are the first steps to feeling empowered to make a change when it comes to reducing
          food waste.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li class="list">
          Overall, the vast majority of participants want to be more conscious about the impact their food choices have
          on the world around them. However, although most of the participants understand that food choices do have some
          kind of impact on the world, they believe it is hard to perceive such effects due to lack of visibility and
          immeasurability of their personal influence.

  <h2 class="title"> Goals and Objectives </h2>
  <div class="section">
    <div class="goals">
      <p class="paragraph">
        <b>Goal:</b> Based on our research, we created a digital game that promotes
        positive emotions and behaviors for young adults ages 18 through 25 living in
        urban city areas to help them reduce food waste.

        <br>
        <br>
        In the game solution, we created opportunities for players to learn about on new recipes
        to minimize food waste, cues to encourage positive food consumption behaviors,
        and social interactions to trigger ripple effects of sustainable behaviors
        among the social group.

        We embedded persuasive techniques including intermixing, obfuscation, Self Determination Theory,
        compliance, and conformity to create psychological distance from a heavy topic.
        <br>
        <br>

        We used the Transformational Framework to apply in our design goals of knowledge, disposition and behavior
        according to the Transformational Framework.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Knowledge-</b> Educate users on how their personal actions can make a difference on food sustainability, and
        how individual food items make a difference on the environment.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Disposition-</b> Transform user’s feelings of guilt about food waste to feelings of empowerment and self
        affirmation towards the problem.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Behavior-</b> Help users change their eating and cooking habits to increase sustainable action.
      </p>

  <h2 class="title"> Design and Playtesting </h2>
  <div class="section">
    <div class="design">
      <p class="paragraph">
        <b> Ideation </b>
        <br>
        <br>
        Throughout our game design process, we used two platforms to brainstorm and ideate
        the game mechanics and interface design (<a href="https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVPHqcu9M=/">Miro</a> and
        <a
          href="https://www.figma.com/file/8d0S1XyLZwLUoovnumY1tg/Iteration-3--Medfi-Prototype?node-id=0%3A1&t=nrZak5lKBFH4WlXl-3">
          Figma</a>)
        <br>
        <br>
        During ideation and early iteration, we created a paper prototype to find a quick way to brainstorm
        game components and mechanics. This was used to playtest and receive feedback on user
        experience pain points.
      <div class="lofiVideo">
        <video width="500" height="500" controls>
          <source src="./videos/zombie_lofi.mp4" type="video/mp4">
        </video>
      </div>
      <br>
      <br>

      <br>
      <br>
      <p class="paragraph">
        As we solidifed our designs into a playable game, our team moved from paper prototype to
        Figma to create a higher fidelity version of the assets and user interface.
        Our programmers brought these assets into Javascript and React to create a higher
        fidelity prototype.
        <br>
        <br>

        We play tested multiple rounds in the lofi, medfi, and highfi prototype stages.
        At each stage, we took user feedback to re-evaluate the
        level design of the game and checking if it is hitting the target of our persuasive goal.
        Below is a sample of our game design chart and level design chart respectively.
