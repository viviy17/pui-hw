        <b> Hi! My name is Vivian Young. I am an Experience Designer and Artist. </b>
        I was formerly a CPA accountant, but always had a passion for art and design.
        <b> I wanted to progress my career in a more creative direction. </b>
        My interdisciplinary experience has allowed me to both creative and analytical in my design work.
        <br>
        <br>
        In my free time, I love to walking outside, going to the movies, and enjoy eating all kinds of food with family
        and friends.
